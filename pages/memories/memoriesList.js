    content: `I am writing this letter on Tisha B’av, after chatzos.  Just spent the morning in Shul saying all the kinnos, detailing the churban habayis along with all the calamities that have befallen on the Jewish people throughout history.  And I’ll be honest, I simply couldn’t stop thinking about the tragedy of losing my dear friend Ari A”H.  His loss is of course a tragedy for the choshuva Rebbetzin, the tmimusdik children, his close friends and family.  But it is also a loss for the entirety of Am Yisrael.  The reality that a Yid as beautiful as Ari can be taken in such a seemingly unjust way, is a direct result of the churban habayais, the galus hashchina.  There’s no other way to explain it.  So it is more than appropriate for me to remember my friend on this day. 
    Even though we both grew up in Los Angeles, I met Ari for the first time a few weeks after I got married.  If I’m not mistaken, we got married pretty much around the same time and a maybe it was a week or two after Sheva brachos, we met at Rabbi Friedman’s Shul after Kabalas Shabbos.  I’ll never forget his smile.  I think at the time he was still wearing a suit, a yeshivishe hat, I may be wrong, but I clearly remember him coming over to me and saying hello.  I don’t remember if he knew who I was from music, I was just getting started in my career so I can’t imagine he knew me from there, or he just heard there was another fresh Chosson from Los Angeles who was in Brooklyn, figured he may need some chizuk…
    I don’t remember exactly when the next time we saw each other but over the years we met up time and time again, sharing diver torah, nigunim, divrei chizuk.  We had a sweet bond.  It was hashgacha pratis that for many years, each time I would come to mir to visit, I would bump into him and R’ Meir Ashkenazi outside the main Beis MIdrash.  Whenever we saw each other outside it as like funny how mamesh every time I came there we would see each other.  
    I’ll be honest, I was jealous of Ari.  Never in a negative way chas veshalom, but in a way that drove me to become a better Yid.  He just seemed to be at peace with himself and his surroundings.  He looked like he was holding so much shelvas hanefesh inside of him.  A n’eimus that I could only dream of obtaining for myself.  
    When my wife and I were mulling over our move to Eretz Yisroel, Ari arranged for me to come daven shachris at Emunas Yisroel in Beitar and then meet with the Rav after shachris.  I felt so honored to walk into the Shul as Ari’s friend.  Felt so honored that he took time to care of me.  A person of Ari’s stature? A Talmid Chochom, Y’rei Shamayim, Chassid, Eved Hashem, is taking time to help me?  
    And then of course we had our Purim Seuda together in your apartment that year, ah, such sweet and good memories.  I remember him saying he has to run out to be with Rav Zucker.  That was the first time I heard of Rav Zucker.  And Ari’s face lit up when he said he has to go to him.  
    I think the next time I saw Ari was at the Sheva brachos he made for Rav Zucker in Ramat Eshkol.  This was after I became a bit mekushar to Rav Zucker, and I happened to be in Eretz Yisroel so I attended.  I remember this wonderful mix of music started playing when Rebbe arrived and the simcha in the air welcoming rebbe into the room.  I remember the feeling of surprise when I heard one my songs as part of the mix.  I again felt so honored that a yid of the stature of Ari listened to my music and added it to the playlist.
    But that night wasn’t only about the music.  It was the first time I heard Ari speak.  And it made such a roshem on me that I remember until this day what he spoke about.  I remember the vort he said.  He spoke about the mishna in Avos which details the way a yid is supposed to live.  Eat bread and salt, lie on the ground, drink from a cup etc…and the mishna ends up saying “אם אתה עושה כן אשריך”.  Ari asked the question, what does it mean, if you do it then ashrecha.  He explained that you can’t really describe the beauty of Yiddishkeit until a person actually experiences it.  אם אתה עושה כן.  Only if you do it then you’ll get it.  And Ari went on to say that we can speak about Rav Zucker forever but we’ll never really get to understand who he is until you actually be his talmid.  And he kept going on and on with this sweet Nigun אם אתה עושה כן…over and over again.  And for the first time in my life I understood what it meant to have a rebbe.  I was filled with joy, filled with longing that one day I’ll be able to speak about my rebbe the same way.  Of course I had many Rebbeim over the years, many who I have such love and respect for.  But to see the ahava that Ari had for his rebbe, it made such an impression on me.  
    I want to add one thing to his vort.  We always hear people talk about what the tzura of a yid is supposed to be.  Besides the obvious physical appearance, there’s so much spoken about the Midos of a yid, the gentle, eidle, sweet presence that a yid should be walking with.  But until you actually meet a yid like that, you’ll never really know.  
    You can read all the Sforim in the world about what a yid is supposed to look like but only “אם אתה עושה כן אשריך”.  If you met Ari, if you spent time with him, then you’ll understand what all the seforim meant.
    And as my heart is overcome with pain and sadness over my friend’s p’tira, I’m filled with a sense of gratitude that by meeting Ari, I know what it’s really supposed to look like.  I know what Chessed is supposed to look like.  I know what a chassid is supposed to look like.  I know what a Talmid in front of his rebbe is supposed to look like.  
    When I first heard that he was sick, my first thought was it’s impossible.  No way it can be him.  No way.  Chas veshalom to say anyone else ya, but for sure not him.  Ari? No way.  
    And when in came to visit the family and Ari came in, I made believe that I was holding it together, but I was in so much pain by the contrast of what I remembered verses what I saw in front of me.  But his beautiful face, his eidelkeit was still there.  My friend was still there.  
    May the chashuva Rebbetzin and the choshuva children know no more tzaar.  May Klal Yisroel know no more tzar.  And may Hashem give you a the ultimate Nechama with binyan beis hamikdash and tchiyas hameisim so we can once again hit play on the sweet playlist of Ari’s nigunim, hear his beautiful torah, and bask in his presence.`

    content: `It's so hard to believe that we are holding here, memories.
    To really grasp Ari Z"L fully it of course won't be enough to tell over some memories, but it
    definitely will keep us aspiring for aliya and growth, which is what underlies all the different
    memories we all have of him.
    Ari. A real friend, a real chavrusa …. a real Yid.
    We started learning together in the Daf Hayomi Kollel on Sorotzkin. It wasn’t just about
    learning a daf a day, it was a full program with many chazaros to insure a kinyan on the
    mesechtos. In general Ari was always into programs and מחייבים that would bring out a
    persons' real potential, and if the Kollel itself didn’t have one or what they had wasn't
    enough for him he would create his own programs, and at times he even upgraded and
    changed programs that yeshivos and kollelim had been using for years before he came
    around. Another mechayev he had was the Dirshu tests he would always be taking, this
    obviously caused some pressure to always be on his game, but he loved that. As a test was
    approaching there was much talk amongst the yungelite about the Dirshu test, he would
    always call it by a slightly different name, he would always stress "it's not just Dirshu, it's
    Dirshu Hashem, we can't lose focus on what this is all about - connecting to the Rebono shel
    olam".
    Learning with Ari wasn't just something you do; start seder, end seder… it was a full
    experience, full of simcha and life. One of the chaburos he said in the Kollel was about the
    use of different types of toys on Shabbos (עי' ספר גבורת הארי ס' כב), he showed up with a
    bag (a Shankys bag of course because they are a bit wider than the Yeshiva Seforim bags,
    כידוע ליודע ארי) full of toys, and throughout the chaburah there were toys being flown
    across the beis medrash and cars speeding down the tables, the avrechim there didn’t know
    what hit them, literally, and they left feeling they got such amazing clarity in that סוגיה.
    Every chaburah was a מעמד, I'm picturing it now ((אמת מה נהדר..., the preparation for hours
    upon hours literally (that is after the hours we spent on just learning the sugyah), he had
    prepared pages and pages of notes and photo copies of different sefarim all organized in a
    booklet he made just for this purpose. He placed a recorder on the table in front and stood
    tall by the shtender with a big smile, shuckling back and forth, a bit nervous that everything
    come out clear and accurate, then, he clapped his hands together and began, with the most
    unique scenario you could imagine, asking the oilam what they think would be the din(or as
    Ari preferred to say 'the rachamim') based on all we have learned the last few weeks. He
    excitedly listened to each person's suggestion, and only then began to present the whole
    sugya from A to Z with great clarity, but always struggling to get out all he wanted to say in
    the allotted time. He made the sugya come alive to all of us.
    
    It was always a living sugya. This is also the reason he loved to see what HaRav Zilberstein
    שליט"א wrote on the topic, real life unique scenarios that brought out clarity in the sugya.
    That is why he wished so much (and was B"H zocheh) to have HaRav Zilberstein's haskama
    on his sefer, it really meant a lot to him.
    
    Ari and I learned so many different limudim together over the years, because the topic was
    not the main point for me, it was such a pleasure to learn with Ari that it didn’t make a
    
    difference what exactly the topic was. We did though share a common libo chafetz,
    mishnayos taharos, which actually caried us throughout the years, from the beginning to the
    end… we are holding in the middle of mikvaos.
    He always needed to get to the bottom of things, and to reach complete clarity in whatever
    he was learning, there was no skipping steps. So, it was time to start נגעים, but Ari was not
    OK with starting with the first Mishnah like most of us would, "Before we start, we need to
    give a few days to going through the pesukim with the basic meforshim so that we can have
    the proper background to start the mesechta" he told me. "If that is what I need to do to be
    able to learn with you so that is what we will do. "
    No point was too basic or simple for him. As you can see from the notes he wrote in his
    seforim, whatever gave him even the littlest bit of clarity he cherished and wrote down,
    always quoting the person's name to give them a good feeling.
    When we were about to start a new sugya, the list of mareh mekomos the rosh chabura
    gave us was only a mareh makom for Ari to start working his magic. Ari would show up the
    next morning with a handmade pamphlet with all of the mareh mekomos on the sugya, not
    just what seforim to see but the sefer itself, a copy of each page of each meforash, those
    that we were given and many that he found on his own that he felt would be helpful to see.
    One pamphlet for me and one for him, only then were we ready to begin. He wiped out at
    least four different writing utensils from his pocket each having its specific purpose (the blue
    and black marks in his sefarim have different meanings) placed them on the table and then
    the fun (which is what learning with Ari was) began.
    
    I didn’t want to bring us back too much to the painful last year but there were the points of
    gadlus that shown though those dark days that I hold on to very tightly and could be a
    source of nechamah to all of us.
    It was Motzae Shabbos, leil shiva asar b'tamuz, when Ari was taken for the first time to the
    ER. I came to stay with him for the night. He had had a seizure on Shabbos and was now fast
    asleep completely wiped out. After a couple of hours, I saw that he was starting to wake up
    so I got up to get closer to him, to see if he needed something after being knocked out from
    the trauma. He slowly opened his eyes and as soon as they were open just enough to see me
    standing there, he whispered with the little kochos he had "Meir, did you rest? Sit, sit you
    need to get some sleep too". He didn’t say, where am I or what happened, even though he
    didn’t yet know what he had gone through and where he was. All he knew was, I just woke
    up and am exhausted, so Meir must also need to sleep, why is he standing looking after me?
    I can't say I wasn’t nogeya b'davar being friends with Ari - it is always nice to be put first.
    It was a few days after Ari got the results of the first MRI when he told me that he really
    wanted to print his sefer for Aron's bar mitzva but he didn’t see how he could possibly
    manage under the circumstances, so we spent many hours together on those "long days"
    working on all that still needed to be done. With some team work (Noach Meir putting
    everything else aside, and others) and a lot of siyata dishmaya, B"H it actually happened.
    This most dear thing to him is what he was busy with until… he sadly reached the point that
    he was no longer able to.
    
    Actually, the process started a few years before when the first mahadura of Gevuras HaAri
    came out for Binyamin's bar mitzva, as a kuntras. A couple of nights before the bar mitzva I
    get a call from Ari "Do you think you could give me your opinion on a few things I need to
    finalize for the kuntres", "Sure when do you want to meet", "Whenever it is good for you", I
    know what that means I thought to myself, so I asked him "Ari, are you already by my
    building?", " Yeah… but really whenever you can… really." He showed me a few points he
    wanted to change, all very subtle, but he was afraid that the changes would make him miss
    the deadline. I told him that these are quite small changes if at all noticeable and I feel that it
    is not worth it to take the risk of it not being ready in time, also it is a kuntres and you can
    perfect it IY"H before the sefer comes out eventually. He nodded and said OK quietly,
    realizing there probably is no eitza but he was a bit discouraged. I showed up at the bar
    mitzva and looked through the beautiful kuntres looking for the mistakes he had wanted to
    fix in order to show him how unnoticeable they actually were, but now the reason they were
    unnoticeable was because… you know the rest yourself. "A heilige sefer needs to be perfect,
    and ראוי לעלות על שולחן מלכים".
    
    We were pushing on all fronts to get the sefer printed as soon as possible, we technically
    had some more time to spare before the bar mitzva but the Rebono shel olam wanted it to
    be ready earlier, as I soon got to see.
    One morning I got a call from the publisher, not the best morning because Ari was on his
    way to Hadassah again, he said "B"H the seforim are about to leave the press where should
    they be delivered? ". I gave him Ari's address and asked him to put a few aside so that I
    could pick them up and bring them with me to the hospital. I understood that Ari's matzav
    wasn’t so good and he probably wouldn't be able to appreciate the sefer at this time. But I
    wanted to keep a copy with me at all times to make sure I catch the first window of
    opportunity to give him the nachas he so deserved. I arrived at the ER to see what till today
    is one of the hardest and most painful memories I have of this tekufa. Not poshut at all what
    Ari went through!
    After many hours in the ER Ari was moved up to a room, and finally was able to get some
    rest. I was outside the room making a phone call, and suddenly I see Ari somehow standing
    strong on his own by the sink washing negel vasser. He took the peach that was on the table,
    sat down crossed his legs like he was relaxing on a park bench, made a bracha and enjoyed
    finally having some food, looking out the window in peace. I couldn't believe what I was
    seeing. We started schmoozing, and when I saw that he was doing well I realized that this
    was the moment I was waiting for, or more correctly the moment Ari was waiting for. I
    started talking about the sefer in general and he asked me where we were up to in the
    preparations and then I told him I had a surprise for him. I took out the copy of Gevuras
    HaAri, straight from the printing press, and handed it to him. He hugged and kissed his sefer
    crying and crying. Then after a minute he got up and started dancing up and down the
    hospital hallway tightly holding his sefer, the torah that he was zoche to bring out in this
    world, close to his heart. No words can accurately describe this site, it was his ahavas
    hatorah that was so real and so deep in his heart, that overcame the tremendous amount of
    confusion and fear he was experiencing in the whole situation he was in, and was being
    expressed at those precious moments. It was Simchas Torah in the middle of Tamuz. I don’t
    think unfortunately, that there was another opportunity from then on, that Ari would have
    
    been able to appreciate the great accomplishment he attained. The Hashgacha Pratis was so
    clear.
    
    Of course, this is all but a tipah min hayam hagadol of my experiences with Ari Z"L, but if we
    could hold on to even some of what we were zoche to see, we can ourselves grow
    tremendously as well as be a source of great aliya for his neshama hatehora.
    
    I can hear Ari saying - " I appreciate all you are doing for me with these memories but you
    know, what is more important is to remember the רבש"ע ". And I am saying back to you Ari,
    remembering you and your way helps us remember the רבש"ע better. דרשו ה' !`

    content: `I'm not able to visit you in person, but I have a lot to tell you. I met Ari for the first time when spending a Shabbos by Rav Zucker about 20 years ago. He was a smiley energetic, excited yid. We davened with Rav Zucker by Rav Tzvi Meyer and enjoyed the highest levels of ruchniyus and shmoozing for that Shabbos. I’m not sure if it was that shabbos, but I remember times that he shleped my bags up and down for me. The truth is that I had heard a lot about Ari before meeting him. Ari was known among Rav Zucker’s talmidim because he was strong like a lion to stay in learning and continue the highest levels of ruchniyus. Rav Zucker would talk a lot about Ari to inspire other talmidim because he was the example of how much a person can learn and grow no matter what challenges there are.
	After meeting, we became close very quickly. At first we were only in touch once in a while. I had a few tapes that I recorded of Rav Zucker’s divrei Torah at Mivaseret and Ari wanted to copy them very much. He followed up as many times as needed until I came to visit him in Lakewood. When I walked into his dorm room, it was more like a chesed center. He handed me a full cup of ice tea from his ice tea gemach and kept refilling it. He copied the tapes I brought and then showed me his big tape library gemach. Wow!
	When we moved to Eretz Yisrael in 2007, Ari did anything he could for us. Our first night there he brought over dinner and he rolled up his sleeves and fixed our trisim. He unpacked and packed our seforim boxes many times (whenever we moved apartments and when we moved to chutz la’aretz, he was an expert). He bought us things that we needed for ruchniyus (seforim) and gashmiyus (hardware stuff). He taught me how to deal with ba’lai dira and other tough people. He taught me what to spend on. Whenever I’m thinking if I should buy a sefer that I want, I think of Ari and then buy it. I remember all of the gedolim pictures on the wall in sanhedria murchevet. I remember the lion costume at the seudah in sanhedria. I remember Ari on the phone with a cheder in Beitar, trying to get the boys in, recording the yiddish conversation because he didn’t fully understand yiddish yet. I remember the Shabbos we spent in Naharia for the Ashkenazi bris. On shabbos morning Ari was playing with his boys in the chatzer, getting them to chase him in a circle as they laughed. My wife remembers the time we went away for Shabbos and you used our apartment. On Sunday, Ari showed up at our door with a bag of toys. It was the replacements for any toys that broke on Shabbos.
	When it came to our Rebbe, Rav Zucker, Ari was tops. He learned and spoke with Rebbe more than all of us talmidim. He recorded whatever Rebbe said, edited it, shared it. Even on car rides to and from Meron he was recording and getting Rebbe to share more Torah and nigunim. He was always going to or coming from a chavrusah with Rebbe. He got very special thank yous in Rebbe’s seforim and was always working to publish new ones. When it came time for Rebbe’s chasunahs Ari took charge. He made sure that we raised more money than our goal, he made sure that the sheva brachos happened. He did the music, the shtick, divrei Torah… Almost every day I listen to the sound tracks that Ari made for the sheva brachos. More recently, I asked Ari if he had any music for a siyum. He sent me exactly what I needed and I use it at many simchas and plan to use it in the future. I would always discuss with him which kosher MP3’s are the best out there. (Please let me know if any of you ever want an MP3 player. I would be happy to buy it for you.)
	We traveled to Meron together on lag ba’omer a few times. Even when I moved back, Ari would call me on the bus ride to or from Meron. We joked that I lost a Sansa MP3 player one year at the Toldos Ahron hadlakah, so I asked him every year if he found it.
Probably the most amazing thing that Ari did for me was on ערב שבת of my oldest son Mordechai’s shalom zachor. On erev Shabbos, Ari came from Beitar to our apartment in Ramat Eshkol with one of his classic Israeli bags full of goods. He had bought me a sefer on עניני ברית and inscribed it. He made a קונטרס with photo copies of מראה מקומות and a personalized cover. He gave me a CD that he made with simcha songs for the occasion. WOW! The first 2 pictures at the bottom are from that special delivery. It’s me holding Mordechai, my shver and my ידיד and the stuff he brought over. After Mordechai’s bris and pidyon ha’ben, Ari brought over recordings of all the music and people who spoke at the simchas, which I still cherish.
When it came time for us to move back to chutz la’aretz. Ari didn’t want it to just be a regular goodbye or seudas preidah. Instead, he arranged for a shabbos his’achdus. Hosting (thanks to the Rebetzin Twersky) Rav Zucker and family, Meir Ahskenazi and family and our family. We shared divrei torah, sang and bonded all shabbos. Just walking through the streets to and from shul is something I still remember.
Since we moved back 10 years ago I have kept up with Ari by phone. We spoke every month or two and it gave me tremendous chizzuk and a breath of Eretz Yisrael. He always answered with the smile that I could hear in his voice “REB NOIYAM! How are you? When are you coming to Eretz Yisrael?” He told me about his latest updates, whether it was becoming a Karliner chassid or which animal he would dress up as the coming purim. He told me about the mics. and mixer at the purim seudah. More recently he told me about the early morning rosh chodesh tisch in Karlin and “Tatty Tuesdays”. I remember thinking afterwards, “I love speaking to Ari, he is always growing, learning, seeking, doing, fresh, excited…”
Specifically, I would call Ari when I had a day off and was heading to Kiryas Yoel. When I would get on the NY state thruway, I would call him. One time, he called me the day before my trip and left a message “Reb Noiyam, you are due for a trip to kiryas yoel and i haven’t heard from you”. The next day I called him and said “Ari, you must have ruach ha’kodesh that you called me one day before I went. How did you know I was planning to go? You probably called one day early so that no one would know you have ruach ha’kodesh”. I think it was during that call that Ari asked me to do some research for him at Satmar. He needed the name of one of the Satmar Rebetzins to put on the family tree that he was working on (I forgot which one. Please let me know if you know which one it was). I asked the guy in the seforim store and he asked the guy in the next store... Eventually we got a phone number of who to call. Ari called me when he got the name he needed and said “Noiyam, eureka!” The problem was that I didn’t know what that word meant because I thought it was yiddish. He said “Noiyam, eureka is a vort uf english”. He explained that it meant a big discovery.
I was zoche to join Ari in skver for the hanachas tefillin. I remember sitting in the Rebba’s office and watching Ari and his father shmooze with the Rebba.
In the last year, we did anything and everything that we could to daven and gather zechusim. We, the Rav Zucker chevra, had kids make brachos on free ice cream from the truck outside my house, we looked into starting or sponsoring a purim costume gemach, we sponsored Rebbe’s trips, we learned biritzifus, we finished tehillim, we did a 40 day machsom li’fi (which ended on the thursday before the petirah).
We can go on forever about Ari’s special and unique מעלה’s. His learning, davening, chesed, chasidus, geshmak, kedusha, simcha, mesirus nefesh, drive to get things done well and right, shimush of Rebbe………………..
When I think of our conversations I think of שם שמים שגור בפיו. The whole conversation was loaded with ’ברוך ה. I heard the story from Meir Ashkenazi about Ari dancing with the sefer Ari wrote and I think אשרי מי שבא לכאן ותלמודו בידו.
To conclude, I want to tell you the שפת אמת which I would say was Ari’s favorite vort during my time in Eretz Yisrael. I assume he heard it from Rav Zucker. The שפת אמת says in פרשת שלח in תרל”ח:
בפסוק אל תיראו את עם הארץ כי לחמנו הם כו'. כי קיום נפשות בנ"י בעוה"ז הוא רק ע"י ההסתר שיש בעולם וצריכין לתקן העשי' עי"ז יש להם קיום בעוה"ז. כי עיקר חלק בנ"י בעולם העליון. לכן כשתיקן הכל הולך אל עולמו. נמצא שאין לאדם למאס ברוב היגיעות שעוברין עליו בעוה"ז. וכעין זה שמעתי מפי קדשו של מו"ז ז"ל. וז"ש לחמנו הם.
Meaning, when we have challenges, we should look at it as spiritual sustenance for our neshama. Ari would say to me whenever there was a tough situation, “!לחמנו הם”
Ari’s vort can help us in this tough time and also give us נחמה that Ari was “מתקן הכל”
